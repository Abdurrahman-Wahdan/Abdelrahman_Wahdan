This a case study for Amadeus UI developer job opportunity. I will give some details down below about the code:
1. The list of cities that you can search for is (Istanbul, Izmir, Antalya, Ankara).
2. The site is simple and only consists of one page. Some of the buttons were not given functionality, as it was not in the requirements.
3. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the filter button was not developed and added to the site. However, the rest of the requirements were completed to the best of my understanding.
4. When you enter the webpage, you will find text and a video for the aesthetics of the page. As you scroll down, you will be able to see the search bar, where you can search for tickets.
